# "The Schimscheimer Family Trio"

This repository houses the official website for "The Schimscheimer Family Trio," a band I am a part of. I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of NextJS 13 and Tailwind CSS. Additionally, to serve our band's mailing list needs, I implemented the SheetDB API, allowing us to use a Google spreadsheet as a lightweight backend.


### Tech Stack:
**NextJS 13:** Chosen for its ease of routing and server side rendering capabilities
**Javascript:** The core programming language used for the project
**Tailwind CSS:** Chosen for its ease of use as well as its custom UI capabilities. I wanted the site to appear as unique as possible.

### Getting Started:

If you'd like to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository
2) Install dependencies using `npm install`
3) Run the project using `npm run dev`
