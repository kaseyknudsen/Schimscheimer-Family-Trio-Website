          <p>
            As if from an actual collection of blood relatives, the music of the
            Schimscheimer Family Trio opens a window into an alternate worldâ€”one
            in which songs become people, sounds describe stories, and music
            falls beyond categorization. The fake siblings (and their fake
            uncle) harness a mixture of woodwind, synthesizer, and percussion
            sounds in creating tuneful odes to their fake relatives,
            semi-traumatic childhood recollections, and intimidating animals of
            note.

              A graduate of the University of Miami, Jon Arkin is an in-demand
              freelance drummer with many notable local, national and
              international artists. His drumming style has been sought out as
              much for his versatility as for his uniqueness. A believer in the
              power of listening, grooving, dynamic balance, and attunement, his
              collaborators attest to his ability to suit the music of the
              moment.
