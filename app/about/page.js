            As if from an actual collection of blood relatives, the music of the
            Schimscheimer Family Trio opens a window into an alternate worldâ€”one
            in which songs become people, sounds describe stories, and music
            falls beyond categorization. The fake siblings (and their fake
            uncle) harness a mixture of woodwind, synthesizer, and percussion
            sounds in creating tuneful odes to their fake relatives,
            semi-traumatic childhood recollections, and intimidating animals of
            note.
